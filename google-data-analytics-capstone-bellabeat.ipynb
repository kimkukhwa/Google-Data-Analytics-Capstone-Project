Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with\nknowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\nBy 2016, Bellabeat had opened offices around the world and launched multiple products. Bellabeat products became available\nthrough a growing number of online retailers in addition to their own e-commerce channel on their website. The company\nhas invested in traditional advertising media, such as radio, out-of-home billboards, print, and television, but focuses on digital\nmarketing extensively. Bellabeat invests year-round in Google Search, maintaining active Facebook and Instagram pages, and\nconsistently engages consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video ads on Youtube and display ads on the Google\nDisplay Network to support campaigns around key marketing dates.\n\n**Questions**\n\nSršen asks you to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart\ndevices. She then wants you to select one Bellabeat product to apply these insights to in your presentation. These questions\nwill guide your analysis:\n1. What are some trends in smart device usage?\n2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nYou will produce a report with the following deliverables:\n1. A clear summary of the business task\n2. A description of all data sources used\n3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data\n4. A summary of your analysis\n5. Supporting visualizations and key findings\n6.

How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\n- Bellabeat customers are more open to fitness ideas that they can practice during the week, during lunch hour, after work, or before going to work.\n- Various Mid to low-level activities can be helpful for the customers to gradually/gently increase their daily activity levels and active times.\n- Notification to log their activities can encourage their habits to track their fitness activities/routine.  \n\n\n3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\nTo target the majority of users:\n\n- In terms of product options and design, Bellabeat customers prefer a wearable they can use daily.\n- In terms of an app push notification, the customers will be interested in learning various low-mid level daily activities they can try during the weekdays.\n- In the app, the customers want to see more low-level activity fitness tracking options such as meditation, breathing exercises and stretching.\n\nTo target the highly active users:\n\n- In terms of product options, highly active customers will prefer a product/services that can track their progress, take on challenges, and compete with other users.\n- In terms of app push notifications, the customers will be interested in learning how to improve their performance, specific techniques, and professional community in a local area.\n- In the app, the customers want to see their quality of break (or sleep).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
